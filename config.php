/*
  ----CHARSET Settings----

 The settings below are used for various operations that are charset sensitive,
 for instance cleaning "user input".  The settings with # in front will need
 to be un-commented (remove the #) to use.

 For "input cleaning", and anywhere else the PHP function htmlspecialchars()
 would normally be used, there is a 3 step process (below) to ensure that the
 data is not corrupted due to differences in charsets.  Note that step
 1 and 3 are skipped if the appropriate settings are not specified (Most sites
 will only need to set CHARSET_CLEAN, step 2):

 1. (Optional step, only run if CHARSET_FROM is set): The input's charset is
    converted from the CHARSET_FROM setting to the CHARSET_CLEAN setting.  It
    is converted either using mb_convert_string() or iconv(), according
    to CLEAN_METHOD setting.

    See http://www.php.net/mb_convert_encoding for more information on setting
    CLEAN_METHOD to mb_convert_encoding.  CHARSET_FROM is used as the 3rd var passed
    to that function.  If CLEAN_METHOD is not set, and the function exists,
    mb_convert_encoding is the default method used to convert the charset.

    See http://www.php.net/iconv for more information on setting CLEAN_METHOD
    to iconv.  CHARSET_FROM is used as the 1st var passed to that function.

    This step, and optionally step 3, are necessary in order to be able to
    clean any charset that is not compatible with the function
    htmlspecialchars() (see step 2)

 2. (Always run): The input is "cleaned" using the PHP function htmlspecialchars()
    This step will use the CHARSET_CLEAN setting for the charset, that charset must
    be compatible with htmlspecialchars().

    This step is always run for security reasons, to prevent a certain type of
    hacking called "Cross Site Scripting" or XSS attack.  If the charset is not
    specified, or is not a compatible charset, the default of ISO-8859-1 is used.

    See http://www.php.net/htmlspecialchars for a list of compatible charsets you can
    use.

 3. (Optional step, only run if CHARSET_TO is set):  The cleaned input's charset
    is converted from the CHARSET_CLEAN setting to the CHARSET_TO setting. It
    is converted either using mb_convert_string() or iconv(), according
    to CLEAN_METHOD setting.

    See http://www.php.net/mb_convert_encoding for more information on setting
    CLEAN_METHOD to mb_convert_encoding.  CHARSET_TO is used as the 2nd var passed
    to that function, at this step.  If CLEAN_METHOD is not set, and the function exists,
    mb_convert_encoding is the default method used to convert the charset.

    See http://www.php.net/iconv for more information on setting CLEAN_METHOD
    to iconv.  CHARSET_TO is used as the 2nd var passed to that function during
    this step.

#define('CHARSET_FROM', 'UTF-8');               //optional, un-comment and modify 'UTF-8' as needed
                                                //to use.  See notes above (step 1)

#define('CHARSET_TO','UTF-8');                  //optional, un-comment and modify 'UTF-8' as needed
                                                //to use.  See notes above (step 3)

#define('CLEAN_METHOD', 'mb_convert_string');   //optional, un-comment to use mb_convert_string()
                                                //in steps 1 and 3 above, or un-comment and change
                                                //the 'mb_convert_string' to 'iconv' to use iconv()
                                                //instead.  Valid settings are 'mb_convert_string'
                                                //and 'iconv'.  See notes above (steps 1 and 3)

 ----Directory Settings----

 needs to be modified, and even then only if changing the admin directory
 name to something other than "admin/" or changing the geo_templates folder

 that changing the actual folder name, besides changing those first 3 folders,
 is not fully supported.

if (!defined('MEMCACHE_ALREADY_INITIALIZED_CUSTOM') && defined('GEO_DIRS_DEFINED')){

  -- CURL / SSL Server Settings

 */

/*
 * If the server has out-dated CA root certificate bundle, that can sometimes result
 * in CURL operations on SSL connections failing, as the "verify peer" option fails.
 *
 * The "SSL verify peer" option for CURL is a GOOD THING, as it prevents what is
 * known as "man in the middle" attack.  If you suspect that your server may have an
 * out-dated CA root certificate bundle, you can temporarily "disable" the verify
 * peer by un-commenting the option below.  This will allow you to do further
 * tests, if CURL connections start to work then you know that you need to update your
 * CA certificate bundle in PHP.
 *
 * If that is the case for your site, the "easiest" way is to contact your host,
 * and tell them that the CURL CA Certificate bundle used by PHP needs to be updated.
 * Or if you run your own server, you can download an updated CA certificate
 * bundle from:
 *
 * http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
 *
 * Obtain an updated CA certificate bundle from that location, upload to your server,
 * then if you have at least PHP 5.3.7, update your php.ini file to let PHP know
 * the location of the new certificate.  See the documentation for that php.ini
 * setting at:
 *
 * http://php.net/manual/en/curl.configuration.php
 *
 * OR if you do not have at least PHP 5.3.7, you can specify the location using
 * the setting further down for GEO_CURL_CAINFO
 *
 * Note that this should only be enabled on a TEMPORARY / TESTING basis ONLY - if
 * you leave this option enabled on a live production site, your site will be
 * vulnerable to "man in the middle" attacks!
 */

/*
 * If your "default" CA certificate bundle is out of date, and your host is not able
 * to update it for you on the server, you can obtain the latest CA cert from the site:
 *
 * http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
 *
 * Then upload it to your site.  Then use the option below to specify the absolute
 * location for the CA certificate bundle.
 *
 * Note that this is only needed if your host is not able to update the "default"
 * certificate used for CURL for some reason.  This is typically needed in WAMP
